🟩 HIGHEST PRIORITY – MUST SOLVE (VERY HIGH WEIGHTAGE)

1. Subnetting (U2): Divide 192.168.10.0/24 into 6 subnets. Find Subnet Mask, Network ID, Broadcast, Host Range for each.

2. VLSM (U2): Allocate VLSM blocks for networks needing: 100 hosts, 50 hosts, 25 hosts, 10 hosts. Base block = 10.0.0.0/24

3. CIDR + Route Aggregation (U2): Aggregate 192.168.1.0/24, 192.168.2.0/24, 192.168.3.0/24, 192.168.4.0/24 into single supernet

4. NAT Translation Table (U2): Private → Public mapping required for 5 devices accessing internet simultaneously. Fill NAT table showing internal IP, port, translated public IP

5. Dijkstra Shortest Path (U3): Graph edges: A-B=2, A-C=5, B-D=1, C-D=2, B-E=3, D-E=1. Compute shortest-path tree & forwarding table from A

🟨 HIGH PRIORITY – VERY LIKELY IN PART B/C

6. Bellman Ford Convergence Table (U3): Compute routing table updates for nodes A, B, C, D until convergence

7. CRC Polynomial Division (U4): Message = 10011010, Generator = 1101. Find transmitted frame with CRC

8. Hamming Code (U4): Encode 1011001 using Hamming(7,4). Show parity bit placement & final codeword

9. Go-Back-N Window Calculation (U4): If sequence numbers = 4 bits → find window size & max pending frames

10. Selective Repeat Window Calculation (U4): With m = 3 sequence bits, compute max sender/receiver window

11. ALOHA Throughput (U4): Offered traffic = 0.5 packets/time unit. Calculate throughput for Pure & Slotted ALOHA

🟦 MEDIUM PRIORITY – ASKABLE BUT LESS FREQUENT

12. Transmission Delay (U1): Frame = 8 KB, Link = 10 Mbps. Find transmission delay

13. Propagation Delay (U1): Fiber link = 1200 km, speed = 2×10^8 m/s. Compute propagation delay

14. Total End-to-End Delay (U1): If transmission = 6 ms, propagation = 14 ms → Total latency = ?

15. Bandwidth Calculation (U1): A video stream requires 400 KB/s. What bandwidth is necessary in Mbps?

---

🟪 LOWER PRIORITY – RARE BUT POSSIBLE

16. TCP Throughput (U5): If RTT = 200ms & Window Size = 32 KB → find throughput

17. RTT Estimation (U5): Old RTT=100ms, Sample=160ms, α=0.25. Compute New Estimated RTT

18. Congestion Window Growth (U5): Initial cwnd=2 MSS. After 5 RTTs (slow start), what is cwnd?

19. DNS Query Time (U5): If each hop adds 12ms & 5 DNS hops occur → total lookup delay?

🟫 LOWEST PRIORITY – RARELY ASKED NUMERICALLY

20. Baud Rate/Encoding (U1): Bit rate = 8 Mbps using 4-level signaling → find baud rate

21. Shannon Capacity (U1): Bandwidth = 4 KHz, SNR = 30dB → compute max data rate
