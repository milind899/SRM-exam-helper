Built this to keep track of my Discrete Mathematics exam preparation. It's a simple checklist app that helps me stay organized with all the units, repeated questions, and important topics.

## Features

- **Topic Checklist**: Broken down by units (Sets, Functions, Logic, Groups, Graphs).
- **Progress Tracking**: Saves my progress automatically so I don't lose it.
- **Repeated Questions**: Highlights questions that keep showing up in past papers.
- **Resources**: Quick links to the playlists and notes I'm using.
- **Search & Filter**: Easy to find specific topics or just see what's left to do.

## Tech Stack

- Tailwind CSS (Tactical Dark Theme)

npm install
npm run dev
```
